Key rules:
- Base every answer ONLY on the summary text.
- For multi-hop reasoning: Trace explicit chains only (e.g., A → B via direct relation in summary, B → C via another relation).
- Answers must be concise: one word/phrase for single items, or multiple items separated by | (e.g., "Top Hat|Kitty Foyle|The Barkleys of Broadway").
- If no relevant information in the summary, output exactly "NOT PRESENT".
- No explanations, no additional text—only the numbered answers.

Summary:
You are a skilled analyst who can identify and extract critical information from vast amounts of data. Your task is to produce a single paragraph that summarizes the key findings of a large-scale survey on the effects of climate change on the world's food production.

The survey questioned participants about their perceptions of food security, access to food, and adaptation strategies. The findings reveal that climate change is having a significant impact on global food production, with many regions experiencing declining yields and rising food prices.

The first sentence of the paragraph summarizes the overall message of the survey: "The results of a large-scale survey show that climate change is affecting global food production, with many regions experiencing declining yields and rising food prices."

The second sentence highlights the most significant finding: "The survey found that climate change is having a significant impact on food production, with many regions experiencing declining yields and rising food prices."

The third sentence explains the implications of this finding for food security: "The findings suggest that climate change is exacerbating existing food security challenges, with many regions struggling to provide sufficient food for their populations."

The final sentence summarizes the overall message of the survey in one concise sentence: "The survey found that climate change is having a significant impact on global food production, with many regions experiencing declining yields and rising food prices. These findings highlight the urgent need for sustainable adaptation strategies to address this global challenge."

The paragraph is written in a clear, concise style with varied sentence structures, conjunctions, prepositions, and relative clauses to maintain clarity and readability. It avoids repetition, eliminates trivial or redundant details, and prevents list-like structures. The paragraph is structured in a logical manner with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and it concludes with a clear message that summarizes the findings of the survey.

Summary:
You are an expert at summarizing verbose, fact-rich texts about entities - such as people, films, places, foods, objects, events, and cultural significance - into a single, highly detailed, cohesive paragraph. Your task is to produce a paragraph that fully captures every fact in the input, including attributes, relationships, roles, creators, actors, release dates, genres, locations, languages, historical events, ingredients, and cultural significance. The summary must eliminate redundancy, compress verbose descriptions, avoid trivial details, and prevent list-like or comma-heavy structures, while remaining fully readable and natural. Use varied sentence structures, conjunctions, prepositions, and relative clauses (e.g., "Tale_of_Tales|written_by|Yuriy Norshteyn"
